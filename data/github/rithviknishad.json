      "text": "@khavinshankar definitely!! Could you help tailwind the async autocomplete field in the https://github.com/coronasafe/care_fe/pull/3744 patient filters?\r\n\r\nGenerally, apart from that, I was thinking of having all the input components have their own validators and also be compliant with form reducers across care since we mostly have only `set_form` and `set_error` only.\r\n\r\nso that, the component's API interface would just take in the additional props (validator, reducerProps) [see this](https://github.com/coronasafe/care_fe/pull/3744/files#diff-2c391d69e3a85e37959e9843913cba1d1db5aa23dac46c81625b168a38c78d9cR18-R29).\r\n\r\nhowever, the components API should still be usable when not used with reducers.\r\nSo I was just taking time to document it clearly so that it's easily maintainable by everyone and changing the component API interface later would be a hassle.\r\n\r\nFor example, the text input is composed like this:\r\nhttps://github.com/coronasafe/care_fe/pull/3744/files#diff-e0e39dd41cb8f0b76d60275fa706cd765c8648107e45183f24781aa0cd51145f\r\nand when used with reducers, the amount of code we write would be so less, but still, it'll render out the errors and field labels without having to write separate components each time."

      "text": "@gigincg I'm thinking of taking this up.\r\n\r\nTwo approaches can be there.\r\n\r\n### 1. Client Side\r\nWhere each preset is traversed and selected at an interval controlled by the client side.\r\nHowever in this method the middleware will not be aware whether a client is using patrol mode or not, and hence other clients who might access the same camera will also not be aware of this. Set preset requests may conflict the order if more than one client accesses it.\r\n\r\n### 2. Server side\r\nAn endpoint for the camera can be exposed to enable patrol mode, and also status response can include whether the resource is in patrol mode or not. Hence every client will be aware whether it's in patrol mode or not. Presets are traversed and selected by the middleware/backend, hence order is maintained regardless of multiple clients accessing the resource. Preset traverse interval can be optionally adjusted by client."
