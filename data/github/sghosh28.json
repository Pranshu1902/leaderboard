I've been diligently working on the project and I'm excited to update you on the progress I've made so far:\r\n- [ x] Resolved the issue where the pop-up doesn't close when clicked outside.\r\n\r\nWith this done, I'm now moving on to tackle the next challenge: addressing the scroll-along-with-page problem. I'm confident I can make headway on this front as well.\r\n\r\nCould you kindly assign this task to me?"
