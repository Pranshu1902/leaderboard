We are exporting ExportMenu and ExportButton JSX components from the useExport hook, so as the useExport hook is called at every render, these also are changing _(function signatures)_ and rerendered. The jumping is because of the difference in time taken to render the icons used inside the 2 above-mentioned functions. \r\n\r\nI think converting the hook to a component should fix it, what are ur thoughts?"
